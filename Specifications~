MENU BAR

* Home
* About
* Education (maybe with a drop-down to show the different kinds of educational services you offer)
* Events
* and either two tabs for Essays and Book
or a single tab Writings (with perhaps a drop-down menu).
* perhaps Resources, for anything that doesn't fit in the above tabs



One or two more tabs would be ok, if necessary, but I think it makes the website easier to navigate if there are only a few, very concise tabs.  Here I'm thinking of the difference between Deanna Zandt's site and Ariel Luckey's.

What do you think? Broadly speaking, how would you choose to divide up the content?  The Home tab might be a little bit non-descriptive (and maybe too cookie-cutter), but it could be a good place to advertise new content, upcoming events, and attention-grabbing info about the book.  I like what Kivel's site has done, which is make the home page the "Get Involved" section, so that you are immediately directed to more information about core issues, the newsletter, resources, projects, and a video.

To be honest, I can't praise the Kivel site enough.  So if it feels like your style, we could try to emulate it, to varying degree.  In particular, I think it's really interesting that you can explore the resources either by issue or by type of resource (article, project, video, etc.)  Would you like this to be something that you'd like your site to do as well?

Thanks also for the bio and publication information from PM Press, and for the information from Electric Embers support.  These will be a big help as we get the project up and running.  I also had a look at the Catalyst Project website, and I'll be referring back to all of these in the coming months.  Thanks also for the list of Goals for the website--it is GREAT that we are starting with this.

As for our project management, I just want to let you know that November will be a very busy month for me.  I am finishing a university degree this semester and also teaching a bit and taking care of Beatrix and her mom.  However, I see my schedule opening up dramatically in mid-December and staying that way throughout the holidays and January.  Another time constraint that I should acknowledge is that I am very new to web development, meaning that I will need a lot more time and concentration to get through the first hurdles than I might later, when things get going.  So it may be unrealistic for me to promise a lot of progress before December.  And while it is tempting to set out to build the best website we can imagine, I think we should plan on making a nice, basic but functional and good-looking site for January, with room to develop as the year goes on.

Let me know what you think!  I'm really excited to be working on this with you.
