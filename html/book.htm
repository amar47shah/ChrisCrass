         <p class="justified right wide"><span class="book-title">Towards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy</span> is for activists engaging with dynamic questions of how to create and support effective movements for visionary systemic change. Chris Crass’s collection of essays and interviews presents us with powerful lessons for transformative organizing through offering a firsthand look at the challenges and the opportunities of anti-racist work in white communities, feminist work with men, and bringing women of color feminism into the heart of social movements. Drawing on two decades of personal activist experience and case studies of anti-racist social justice organizations, Crass insightfully explores ways of transforming divisions of race, class, and gender into catalysts for powerful vision, strategy, and movement building in the United States today.</p>
         <p class="justified right wide">Over the last two decades, activists in the United States have been experimenting with new politics and organizational approaches that stem from a fusion of radical political traditions and liberation struggles. Drawing inspiration from women of color feminism, justice struggles in communities of color, anarchist and socialist movements, the broad upsurges of the 1960s and '70s, and social movements in the Global South, a new generation of activists has sought to understand the past while building a movement for today’s world. <span class="book-title">Towards Collective Liberation</span> contributes to this project by examining two primary dynamic trends in these efforts: 1) the anarchist movement of the 1990s and 2000s, through which tens of thousands of activists were introduced to radical politics, direct action organizing, democratic decision making, and the profound challenges of taking on systems of oppression, privilege, and power in society at large and in the movement itself; and 2) white anti-racist organizing efforts from the 2000s to the present as part of a larger strategy to build broad-based, effective multiracial movements in the United States.</p>
         <p class="justified right wide">Crass’s collection begins with an overview of the anarchist tradition as it relates to contemporary activism and an in-depth look at Food Not Bombs, one of the leading anarchist groups in the revitalized radical Left in the 1990s. The second and third sections of the book combine stories and lessons from Crass’s experiences of working as an anti-racist and feminist organizer, combining insights from the Civil Rights Movement, women of color feminism, and anarchism to address questions of leadership, organization building, and revolutionary strategy. In section four, Crass discusses how contemporary organizations have responded to the need for white activists to lead anti-racist efforts in white communities and how these efforts have contributed to multiracial alliances in building a broad-based movement for collective liberation. Offering rich case studies of successful organizing, and grounded, thoughtful key lessons for movement building, <span class="book-title">Towards Collective Liberation</span> is a must-read for anyone working for a better world.</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p class="justified across">“Many call for a revitalized Left to challenge the neoliberal war on the 99%, but few explain what that might look like.  Chris Crass not only shows us what an energized radical movement looks like, he demonstrates that it is already here—in anti-racist movements, in women-of-color feminism, in queer politics, in anti-imperialist and anti-war movements, and in a movement-based anarchism grounded in the struggles of ordinary people to collectively resist oppression and dispossession while building liberatory, democratic communities of resistance.  Crass understands all of these movements as a source of strength and solidarity, not diversions from the class struggle.  Toward Collective Liberation ought to be essential reading for anyone who believes a different Revolution is possible.”</p>

               <p class="justified across">"With compelling honesty Chris Crass shares his journey toward understanding his own privilege in order to become a more effective ally in struggles for justice.  Towards Collective Liberation provides inspiration and practical guidance for working across differences of race, class, sexuality, and gender.  It is a thoughtful and engaging handbook for our times."</p>

            <blockquote>
               <p class="justified across"><span class="book-title">Towards Collective Liberation</span> is an important contribution to the history of social movement in the US. It a powerful, beautifully written account of twenty years of political organizing in the anarchist movement, by a young man whose entire life has been dedicated to the struggle for social justice. The book is a careful analysis of the origins, strategies and debates within movements like Food Not Bombs, the Rural Organizing Project, the Catalyst Project, showing that “anarchist organizing” is not an oxymoron. Most impressive is Crass’s commitment to confront the sexism and racism within the movement and willingness to scrutinize his own life in this perspective. For anyone interested in learning about the soil from which the Global Justice and Occupy Movements have sprouted from, this is an essential read.</p>

               <p class="justified across">“Chris Crass goes into the grassroots to produce a political vision that will catalyze political change. Drawing from the history of the anarchist tradition, Crass offers lessons and inspiration for a revitalized fully human left, alert to the distinctions between people and the social hierarchies that smother the full liberation of our humanity unmarked. These are words from the heart, overflowing onto the streets.”</p>
