“Chris Crass offers a precious gift that new generations of young activists especially are starving for: a vision and strategy for social change rooted in love and soul. Unitarian Universalist youth movements in particular have found solace and hope in Crass’s words and leadership. And for all those struggling with cultures of critique and competition woven through our movements, his work provides a healing approach to the pursuit of collective liberation. As a long-time organizer, Crass has learned to prioritize his own spirituality, and link it with his work against systemic injustice. The result: he is a compelling resource blending personal testimony, lessons from a diversity of organizations, and historical insights to ground and sustain our efforts.”

Chris Crass is writer/educator/activist who keeps his eye on the prize: to work for collective liberation, remembering that mine is interdependent with yours."
