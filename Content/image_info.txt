Here are some pictures for the site.  I will send some more of me specifically leading workshops or giving talks. 

First attachment: Leading "Anti-Racism for Collective Liberation" workshop with Amie Fishman of Catalyst Project at U.S. Social Forum in Atlanta, Georgia.

Second: Participating in a non-violent blockage of Sheriff Joe Arpaio attempting to lead a raid on Latino communities in Phoenix, Arizona.

Third: Leading a workshop on "Lessons from Ella Baker's Organizing Model"

Fourth: At an Occupy Knoxville demonstration with my partner Jardana Peacock and our son River

The next bunch are all pics of a butcher papered talk on the "Lessons from the Seattle WTO mass actions for our direct action organizing today" - I thought maybe they could be an interesting little slideshow as it does present the main points and gives people a flavor of one of my talks.

The last twitter pic is just a head shot in case it is useful.
