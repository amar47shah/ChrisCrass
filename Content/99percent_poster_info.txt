Would be cool to incorporate this poster project I did with Melanie Cervantes somewhere.  This has the poster as well as on statement I wrote about the project.  People can download it here as well.

And here is the poster in English and Spanish.  If there is a way to make these downloadable on my site, that would be cool as well.
